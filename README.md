# crwm

Crwm (pronounced crumb) is a tiling window manager somewhat inspired by plan9's acme text editor, as well as a variety of window managers such as bspwm, i3wm, rio, dwm, and others.

The essential concept behind crwm is that a series of columns each containing a series of rows is a functional and efficent way of managing the tiling window space. It produces practical ways of managing visible windows, and keeps the system as a whole managable in the eyes of both the programmer and the user.

- I used the [xwm](https://github.com/mcpcpc/xwm) by [Michael Czigler](https://github.com/mcpcpc) as a reference which was incredibly helpful due to the lack of documention on xcb
